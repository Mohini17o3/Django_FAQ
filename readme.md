# Django FAQ API Project

## Overview

This project is a Django-based FAQ management application that allows users to:

- View frequently asked questions (FAQs)
- Add new FAQs
- Manage and retrieve FAQ data via API
- Use HTML views for easy interaction with the system

The application provides both **web views** (for interacting with the FAQ system through a browser) and a **REST API** (for integrating the system with other services or for testing).

---

## Features

- **CRUD operations** for FAQs
- **JSON API** for retrieving and posting FAQs
- **HTML views** for a user-friendly interface to add FAQs and view existing ones
- **Cache** for optimized API calls
